# LangGraph Beginner Guide

## 1. What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is an open-source library for building **stateful**, **multi-agent** LLM applications. It enables fine-grained control, looping, and persistence in AI workflows.

### Key Features
- **Loops & Branching**: Unlike DAG-based systems, supports conditional logic and iteration.
- **State Persistence**: Built-in saving/resuming of app state ‚Äî supports error recovery and human handoffs.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Enables manual interventions at checkpoints.
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time output streaming at token-level granularity.
- **High Controllability**: Precise control over state transitions and workflow decisions.
- **LangChain & LangSmith Compatible**, but can run standalone.

## 2. Technical Inspirations

LangGraph is inspired by:

### üß† Pregel (Google)
- Vertex-centric graph processing model.
- Iterative computing using **supersteps**.
- LangGraph borrows:
  - Loop execution model.
  - Parallelism across graph nodes.

### üîÑ Apache Beam
- Unified model for batch & stream processing.
- LangGraph borrows:
  - Stream-ready workflow design.
  - State checkpointing and fault tolerance.

### üîó NetworkX
- Python graph library for building/visualizing directed graphs.
- LangGraph borrows:
  - API design.
  - Graph-based workflow modeling (nodes & edges).

## 3. Graph-Based Design Principles

### Why Graphs?

Graph data structures are intuitive for modeling workflows and control flows:

- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent computation units.
- **Edges**: Represent transitions and control paths.
- **Types**:
  - Directed / Undirected
  - Weighted / Conditional

### Benefits in LangGraph
- Natural for **complex workflows**, conditions, and loops.
- **Dynamic**: Easy to extend with new nodes and paths.
- **Parallelism**: Execute multiple nodes simultaneously.
- **State-driven**: Nodes modify and pass along a shared `state`.

## 4. LangGraph Core Concepts

### üßæ State
- Shared across nodes.
- Can be a `TypedDict`, `Pydantic model`, or any Python object.

### üß© Nodes
- Python functions (sync or async).
- Perform LLM calls, business logic, or side effects.
- Receive `state` and return an updated `state`.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Edges
- Define next step(s) from each node.
- **Static**: Fixed transition.
- **Conditional**: Based on state.
- **Parallel**: Multiple downstream nodes in one step.

### üß† Example Execution Model

```python
graph.add_node("start", start_fn)
graph.add_node("check", check_user_input)
graph.add_conditional_edges("check", check_decision_fn)
graph.set_entry_point("start")
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### MemorySaver
- Built-in persistence utility.
- Supports saving intermediate state across steps for:
  - Checkpointing
  - Recovery
  - Time-travel debugging

### Interrupt Points
- Use `interrupt_before` config to allow human input mid-process.

### Integration with Tools
- Example: **Tavily** search engine for retrieval-augmented tasks.

## 6. Debugging with LangSmith

- **Trace execution**: Visualize state transitions.
- **Evaluate models**: Accuracy, relevance, latency.
- **Manage datasets**: Upload test cases or logs.
- **Best practice**: Use separate LangSmith projects per LangGraph workflow.

## 7. Use Case: Multi-Turn Chatbot

Example: Multi-turn chatbot with optional internet tool.

- Part 1: Simple ChatBot.
- Part 2: Add tool like **Tavily** to improve factual answers.

## 8. Summary

LangGraph offers a powerful new way to build **agent workflows** using graph structure:

- Fine-grained control over logic and state
- Inspired by scalable graph processing systems
- Seamless with LangChain + LangSmith
- Ideal for RAG, agent planning, chatbots, and automation pipelines
